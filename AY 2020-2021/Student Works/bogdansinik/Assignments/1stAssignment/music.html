            Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late<br>
            1940s and early 1950s.It originated from musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, and country music.<br>
            While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s, and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire <br>
            its name until 1954.n the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally<br>
            replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s.The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided <br>
            by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, <br>
            electric bass guitars and drum kits became popular in classic rock.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><q>Sympaty for the devil</q> by Rolling Stones</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 19px;">
            This is my favourite song. I like its lyrics, it's rhythm and everything else connected to it. The song is about many bad things done by people.<br>
            It blames people, not the devil, for everything evil that is happening on our planet.

                Please allow me to introduce myself
                I'm a man of wealth and taste
                I've been around for a long, long years
                Stole million man's soul an faith
                And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
                Had his moment of doubt and pain
                Made damn sure that Pilate
                Washed his hands and sealed his fate
                Pleased to meet you
                Hope you guess my name
                But what's puzzling you
                Is the nature of my game
                Stuck around St. Petersburg
                When I saw it was a time for a change
                Killed Tsar and his ministers
                Anastasia screamed in vain
                I rode a tank
                Held a general's rank
                When the blitzkrieg raged
                And the bodies stank
                Pleased to meet you
                Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
                Ah, what's puzzling you
                Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
                I watched with glee
                While your kings and queens
                Fought for ten decades
                For the gods they made
                I shouted out
                Who killed the Kennedys?
                When after all
                It was you and me
                Let me please introduce myself
                I'm a man of wealth and taste
                And I laid traps for troubadours
                Who get killed before they reached Bombay
                Pleased to meet you
                Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
                But what's puzzling you

                Pleased to meet you
                Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
                But what's confusing you
                Is just the nature of my game
                Just as every cop is a criminal
                And all the sinners saints
                As heads is tails
                Just call me Lucifer
                'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
                So if you meet me
                Have some courtesy
                Have some sympathy, and some taste
                Use all your well-learned politnesse
                Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
                Pleased to meet you
                Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
                But what's puzzling you
